    		<h3>Step 1</h3>
    		<p>At the beginning of each round, the player will be presented
                with a grid of cards, all face-down. Half of these cards have
                questions on their face, the other half have the answers to those
                questions.</p>

    <tr>
     	<td>
     		<h3>Step 2</h3>
     		<p>The player must find the matching cards by selecting two
                cards at a time to flip over. If the cards are a match, they remain
                face-up. If not, the cards are flipped back over, and the player
                must remember their location.</p>
